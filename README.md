# Homework-01-coderefactor
This is a repository for Homework 01 which is a code refactor for a company called horiseon marketing agency

In this refactor for Horiseon Marketing Agency I went into the code and added semantic tags to create better organization in the HTML and follow a more logical structure. I did this by replacing unnecessary div tags with the appropriate semantic tags such as header, main, section, aside, and footer.

I also added alt attributes to all images on the web page to make it more accessible. Along with alt attributes I added an new website title that relates more to the company and allows their name to be seen more. 

All changes made in the HTML have been listed with a comment next to the change. 

After correcting the code in the HTML page, I reorganized the CSS file to follow the semantic structure of the web page in the HTML doc. I further organized this structure with comments indicating which section each CSS style is in with relationship to its HTML location.
